# Variables

Variables in programming language are used to store data, so they can later used in the program.

There are few types of variable in Rust:

- [Vaiables and Mutability](101-Variables-and-Mutability.md): learn about variables and their mutability and immutability.
- [Contants](102-Contants.md): learn about constant variables.
- [Shadowing](103-Shadowing.md): learn about the shadowing features in the variables
- [Len Functions](104-len-function.md)
