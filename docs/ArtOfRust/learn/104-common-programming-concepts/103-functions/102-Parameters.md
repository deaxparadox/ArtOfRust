# Parameters

We can define functions to have parameters, which are special variables that are part of a functionâ€™s signature.

- When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called arguments.

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```

- The declaration of another_function has one parameter named `x`. The type of `x` is specified as `i32`. When we pass `5` in to `another_function`, the `println!` macro puts `5` where the pair of curly brackets containing `x` was in the format string.


When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}
```

- This example creates a function named `print_labeled_measurement` with two parameters. The first parameter is named `value` and is an `i32`. The second is named `unit_label` and is type `char`. The function then prints text containing both the `value` and the `unit_label`.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The measurement is: 5h
```
