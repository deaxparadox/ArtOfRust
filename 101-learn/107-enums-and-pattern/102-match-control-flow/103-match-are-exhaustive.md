# Matches are Exhaustive

There’s one other aspect of `match` we need to discuss: the arms’ patterns must cover all possibilities. 

- Consider this version of our `plus_one` function, which has a bug and won’t compile:

```rs
    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }

```

- We didn’t handle the `None` case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this error:

```bash
$ cargo run
