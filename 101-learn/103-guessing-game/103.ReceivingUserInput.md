# Receiving User Input

To handle user input:

```rs
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
```

- the line `.read_line(&mut guess)` calls the `read_line` method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. 
- Weâ€™re also passing `&mut guess` as the argument to read_line to tell it what string to store the user input in. 

- The `&` indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times.
