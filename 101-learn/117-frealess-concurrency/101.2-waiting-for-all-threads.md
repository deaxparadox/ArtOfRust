# Waiting for All threads to Finish Using join Handlers

The code in previous example, "creating new thread", -- not only stops the spawned thread prematurely most of the time due to the main thread ending, but because there is no guarantee on the order in which threads run, we also canâ€™t guarantee that the spawned thread will get to run at all!

We can fix the problem of the spawned thread not running or ending prematurely by saving the return value of `thread::spawn` in a variable.

- The return type of `thread::spawn` is `JoinHandle`. 
- A `JoinHandle` is an owned value that, when we call the `join` method on it, will wait for its thread to finish.
- Let see how to use the `JoinHandle` of the thread we created and call `join` to make sure the spawned thread finishes before main exits:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

- Calling `join` on the handle blocks the thread currently running until the thread represent by the handle terminates.
- *Blocking* a threads means that thread is prevented from preforming work or exiting. 
- Because we've put the call to `join` after the main thread's `for` loop,

```rust
hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
hi number 6 from the spawned thread!
hi number 7 from the spawned thread!
hi number 8 from the spawned thread!
hi number 9 from the spawned thread!
```

- The two threads continue alternating, but the main thread waits because of the call to `handle.join()` and does not end until the spawned thread is finished.

But let's see what happens when we instead move `handle.join()` before the `for` loop in `main`, like this:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}
```

- The main thread will wait for the spawned thread to finish and then run its `for` loop, so the output won't be interleaved anymore:

```bash
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
hi number 6 from the spawned thread!
hi number 7 from the spawned thread!
hi number 8 from the spawned thread!
hi number 9 from the spawned thread!
hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
```
