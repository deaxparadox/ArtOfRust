# Using move Closures and Threads

The `move` keyword with closures passsed to `thread::spawn` because the closrue will then take owership of the value it uses from the environment, thus transferring ownership of those values from one thread to another.

- To use data from the main thread in the spawned thread, the spawned thread’s closure must capture the values it needs.
- Let see an attempt to create a vector in the main thread and use it in the spawned thread. However, this won’t yet work, as you’ll see in a moment.

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

- The closures uses `v`, so it will capture `v` and make it part of the closure's environment.
- Because `thread::spawn` runs this closure in a new thread, we should be able to access v inside that new thread.
- But when we compile this example, we get the following error:

```rust
$ cargo run

help: to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword

error: could not compile `threads` due to previous error
```

- By adding the `move` the keyword before the closure, we force the closure to take ownership of the values it's using rather than allowing Rust to infer that it should borrwo  the values.
- This modification will compile and run as we intend:

```rust
