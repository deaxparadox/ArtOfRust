# Grouping Related Code in Modules

*Modules* let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse. Modules also allow us to control the *privacy* of items, because code within a module is private by default. Private items are internal implementation details not available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the items within them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and depend on them.

As an example, let’s write a library crate that provides the functionality of a restaurant. We’ll define the signatures of functions but leave their bodies empty to concentrate on the organization of the code, rather than the implementation of a restaurant.

In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as *front of house* and others as *back of house*. Front of house is where customers are; this encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take orders and payment, and bartenders make drinks. Back of house is where the chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and managers do administrative work.

To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested modules. Create a new library named `restaurant` by running `cargo new restaurant --lib`; then enter the code into *src/lib.rs* to define some modules and function signatures. Here’s the front of house section:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rs
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```

We define a module with the `mod` keyword followed by the name of the module (in this case, `front_of_house`). The body of the module then goes inside curly brackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case with the modules `hosting` and `serving`. Modules can also hold definitions for other items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, and functions.


By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why they’re related. Programmers using this code can navigate the code based on the groups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it easier to find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new functionality to this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.


Earlier, we mentioned that *src/main.rs* and *src/lib.rs* are called crate roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two files form a module named `crate` at the root of the crate’s module structure, known as the *module* tree.

```
crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment

```

This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside one another; for example, `hosting` nests inside `front_of_house`. The tree also shows that some modules are *siblings* to each other, meaning they’re defined in the same module; `hosting` and `serving` are siblings defined within `front_of_house`. If module A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the *child* of module B and that module B is the *parent* of module A. Notice that the entire module tree is rooted under the implicit module named `crate`.
