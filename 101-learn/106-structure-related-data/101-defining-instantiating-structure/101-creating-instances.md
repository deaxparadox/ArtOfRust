# Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct Updates 

It's often usefull to create a new instance of a struct that includes most of the values from another instance, but changes some. You can do this using *struct updated syntax*.

```rs
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
}
```

we show how to create a new `User` instance in `user2` regularly, without the update syntax. 

- We set a new value for `email` but otherwise use the same values from `user1` that we created:

```rs
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
}
```

The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.


```rs
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```

The code creates an instance in `user2` that has a different value for `email` but has the same values for the `username`, `active`, and `sign_in_count` fields from `user1`. 

- The `..user1` must come last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the corresponding fields in `user1`, but we can choose to specify values for as many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in the structâ€™s definition.

Note that the struct update syntax uses `=` like an assignment; this is because it moves the data:

- In this example, we can no longer use `user1` as a whole after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`. 
- If we had given `user2` new String values for both `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count` values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`
