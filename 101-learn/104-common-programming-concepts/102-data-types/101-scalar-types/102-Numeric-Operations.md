# Numeric Operations

Rust supports the basic mathematical operations youâ€™d expect for all the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. 

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```
