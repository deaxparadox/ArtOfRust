# Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.

- Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```
