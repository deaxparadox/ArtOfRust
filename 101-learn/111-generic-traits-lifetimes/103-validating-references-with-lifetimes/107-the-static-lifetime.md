# The Static Lifetime

One special lifetime we need to discuss is `'static`, which denotes that the affected reference can live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals have the `'static` lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:

```rs
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
    let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
}
```

The text of this string is stored directly in the programâ€™s binary, which is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is `'static`.

You might see suggestions to use the `'static` lifetime in error messages. But before specifying `'static` as the lifetime for a reference, think about whether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your program or not, and whether you want it to. Most of the time, an error message suggesting the `'static` lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the solution is fixing those problems, not specifying the `'static` lifetime.


### Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together

Let's briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, traits bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!

```rs
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest_with_an_announcement(
        string1.as_str(),
        string2,
        "Today is someone's birthday!",
    );
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}

use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann);
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

This is the `longest` function, that returns the longer of two string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named `ann` of the generic type `T`, which can be filled in by any type that implements the `Display` trait as specified by the `where` clause. This extra parameter will be printed using `{}`, which is why the `Display` trait bound is necessary. Because lifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter `'a` and the generic type parameter `T` go in the same list inside the angle brackets after the function name.
