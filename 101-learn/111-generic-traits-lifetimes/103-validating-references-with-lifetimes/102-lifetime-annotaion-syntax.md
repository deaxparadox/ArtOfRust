# Lifetime Annotation Syntax

Lifetime annotations don't change how long any of the references live. Rather, they describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes. Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.

Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophec (`'`) and are usually all lowercase and very short, like generic types. Most people use the name `'a` for the first lifetime annotation. We place lifetime parameter annotations after the `&` of a reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.

Here are some examples: a reference to an i32 without a lifetime parameter, a reference to an i32 that has a lifetime parameter named `'a`, and a mutable reference to an `i32` that also has the lifetime `'a`.

```rs
&i32        // a reference
&'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
```

One lifetime annotation by itself doesn’t have much meaning, because the annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other. Let’s examine how the lifetime annotations relate to each other in the context of the `longest` function.

## Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures

To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the generic *lifetime* parameters inside angle brackets between the function name and the parameter list.

We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value. We’ll name the lifetime `'a` and then add it to each reference:

```rs
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

This code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it with the main function.

The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime `'a`, the function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long as lifetime `'a`. The function signature also tells Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime `'a`. In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the `longest` function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values referred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want Rust to use when analyzing this code.

----------

Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we’re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather, we’re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t adhere to these constraints. Note that the `longest` function doesn’t need to know exactly how long `x` and `y` will live, only that some scope can be substituted for `'a` that will satisfy this signature.

When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust compiler does can be simpler. If there’s a problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps away from the cause of the problem.

When we pass concrete references to longest, the concrete lifetime that is substituted for `'a` is the part of the scope of `x` that overlaps with the scope of `y`. In other words, the generic lifetime `'a` will get the concrete lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of `x` and `y`. Because we’ve annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter `'a`, the returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the lifetimes of `x` and `y`.

----------


Let's look at thow the lifetime annotations restrict the `longest` function by passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes.

```rs
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");

    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
        println!("The longest string is {}", result);
    }
}
```

In this example, `string` is valid until the end of the outer scope, `string2` is valid until the ned of the inner scope, and `result` references something that is valid until the end of the inner scope. Run this code, you'll see that the borrow checker approves; it will compile and print the `The longest string is long string is long`.

Next, let’s try an example that shows that the lifetime of the reference in `result` must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. We’ll move the declaration of the `result` variable outside the inner scope but leave the assignment of the value to the `result` variable inside the scope with `string2`. Then we’ll move the `println!` that uses `result` to outside the inner scope, after the inner scope has ended.

```rs
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

When we try to compile this code, we get this error:

```rs
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0597]: `string2` does not live long enough

7 |     }
  |     - `string2` dropped here while still borrowed
8 |     println!("The longest string is {}", result);
  |                                          ------ borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error
```

The error shows that for `result` to be valid for the `println!` statement, `string2` would need to be valid until the end of the outer scope. Rust knows this because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and return values using the same lifetime parameter `'a`.

As humans, we can look at this code and see that `string1` is longer than `string2` and therefore `result` will contain a reference to `string1`. Because `string1` has not gone out of scope yet, a reference to `string1` will still be valid for the `println!` statement. However, the compiler can’t see that the reference is valid in this case. We’ve told Rust that the lifetime of the reference returned by the `longest` function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the references passed in.
