# In Method Definitions

We can implement methods on structs and enums and use generic types in their definitions, too. Below example shows the `Point<T>` struct we defined, with a method named `x` implemented on it.


```rs
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

Here, we’ve defined a method named `x` on `Point<T>` that returns a reference to the data in the field `x`.


Note that we have to declare `T` just after `impl` so we can use `T` to specify that we’re implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`. By declaring `T` as a generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type. We could have chosen a different name for this generic parameter than the generic parameter declared in the struct definition, but using the same name is conventional. Methods written within an `impl` that declares the generic type will be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what concrete type ends up substituting for the generic type.

We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the type. We could, for example, implement methods only on Point<f32> instances rather than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type. Below we use the concrete type `f32`, meaning we don’t declare any types after `impl`.

```rs
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}

```

This code means the type `Point<f32>` will have a `distance_from_origin` method; other instances of `Point<T>` where `T` is not of type `f32` will not have this method defined. The method measures how far our point is from the point at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical operations that are available only for floating point types.

Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren’t always the same as those you use in that same struct’s method signatures.

Below uses the generic types `X1` and `Y1` for the `Point` struct and `X2` `Y2` for the mixup method signature to make the example clearer. The method creates a new `Point` instance with the `x` value from the `self` `Point` (of type `X1`) and the `y` value from the passed-in `Point` (of type Y2).

```rs
struct Point<X1, Y1> {
    x: X1,
    y: Y1,
}

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```

In main, we’ve defined a `Point` that has an `i32` for `x` (with value `5`) and an `f64` for `y` (with value `10.4`). The `p2` variable is a `Point` struct that has a string slice for `x` (with value `"Hello"`) and a `char` for `y` (with value `c`). Calling mixup on `p1` with the argument `p2` gives us `p3`, which will have an `i32` for `x`, because `x` came from `p1`. The `p3` variable will have a `char` for `y`, because `y` came from `p2`. The `println!` macro call will print `p3.x` = `5`, `p3.y` = `c`.
